            <br> however it was not the best childhood. Their father was a drunk and their mother was a prostitute who would argue
            <br> and beat their children. On his 18th birthday in fear that their parents would kill Orihime, who at the time was only 3 years old 
            <br> he took her and ran away from their parents raising her on his own. Years later he would sadly pass on due to a fatal car accident
            <br> leaving Orihime essentially all alone. It was around this time that she would meet Substitute Soul Reaper Ichigo Kurosaki
            <br> who would go on to save her life from the soul of her deceased brother who had become a Hollow. 
            <br> However neither of them could know that this was only the start of something that would change their lives forever.
